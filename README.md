# botcoin
A bitcoin trader bot under construction using Poloniex API

I am using [this](https://github.com/s4w3d0ff/python-poloniex) Poloniex API wrapper.
Install it before running botcoin.

For a while this program just display the last currency pair price in the chart. 
I am elaborating a trading strategy to start trading with this code.
Make sure you have a key and a secret from Poloniex to test this code. Edit it manually.

First run Model.py to collect the price and then animate.py to display the chart.
